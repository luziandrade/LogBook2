This is the second CA lab book and should be completed based on the work you completed for Lab 5 - Building and testing with Gradle. Remember to include the URL of your github repository. This is an individual assignment. Take time to review the associated marking rubric in BBL.

This assignment is worth 20% of the module mark.
